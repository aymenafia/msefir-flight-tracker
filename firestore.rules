/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset supports a flight tracking application with public, temporary chat rooms. It assumes anonymous user authentication. The security model prioritizes public read access for flight and room data while restricting writes to a trusted backend process. For user-generated content (messages), any authenticated (anonymous) user can create messages, but cannot modify or delete them, ensuring data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /flights/{flightId}: A read-only cache of public flight data, managed by the backend.
 * - /rooms/{flightId}: Read-only information about a flight's chat room, managed by the backend.
 * - /rooms/{flightId}/messages/{messageId}: User-generated messages. Publicly readable, but can only be created by signed-in users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Backend-Managed Data: The `/flights` and `/rooms` collections are treated as read-only for all clients. This implies that a trusted server environment (e.g., Cloud Functions) is responsible for all write operations, preventing any client-side tampering with core application data.
 * - Anonymous Contribution: Any user who has authenticated anonymously can create messages. To prevent impersonation, the `userId` field in a new message must match the creator's `request.auth.uid`.
 * - Immutable Messages: Once a message is created, it cannot be updated or deleted by any client. This simplifies the security model and prevents content manipulation in public chat rooms.
 * - Public Read Access: All data is considered public and can be read by anyone, including unauthenticated users, to facilitate the app's core function of providing flight information and chat access without a mandatory sign-up.
